stages:
  # Optional webhook stage: pipelines triggered by external services (like Contentful)
  # will run jobs in this stage first. To trigger from Contentful:
  # 1) In GitLab: Project > Settings > CI/CD > Pipeline triggers -> Add trigger
  #    - Note the trigger token and the project ID
  # 2) Create a Contentful webhook that POSTS to:
  #    https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/<PROJECT_ID>/trigger/pipeline?token=<TRIGGER_TOKEN>&ref=main
  #    (set ref=main or the branch you want the pipeline to run on)
  # 3) Optionally include form fields named CONTENTFUL_EVENT or CONTENTFUL_ENTRY_ID
  #    (GitLab will expose those as CI variables inside the pipeline)
